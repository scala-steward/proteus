**Proteus** is a **[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) open source library** for working with **[Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)** and **[gRPC](https://grpc.io/)**.

It is designed to be **code-first**, meaning that it is able to generate Protobuf codecs and .proto files directly from your Scala code.

It also provides a **declarative way to define gRPC services** in Scala, a bit like [tapir](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/) does for HTTP services. You can define messages, RPCs, and services in Scala, then generate clients and servers for them, using a variety of backends (direct style, Future, ZIO, fs2, Ox).

It is available for Scala 3.3.x LTS and later versions. The core module is available for both Scala JVM and Scala.js.

### Consult the [Documentation](https://ghostdogpr.github.io/proteus/) to learn how to use Proteus.
