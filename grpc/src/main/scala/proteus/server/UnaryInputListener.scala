/**
  * A `ServerCall.Listener` base class for RPCs with a single (unary) request.
  *
  * Implements the gRPC protocol contract: exactly one `onMessage` before
  * `onHalfClose`. A protocol-violating client that sends zero or more than one
  * message has the call closed with `Status.INTERNAL` before the user handler
  * is invoked.
  *
  * Subclasses provide [[onRequest]] (invoked when the half-close arrives with
  * a valid single request) and may override [[onCallCancelled]] and
  * [[onCallReady]] for cancellation / back-pressure plumbing.
  *
  * Thread-safety: gRPC's serializing executor invokes listener callbacks with
  * happens-before between invocations, so plain `var`s suffice for state held
  * across `onMessage` / `onHalfClose`.
